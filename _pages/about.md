I am currently a **Ph.D. student** in the **Department of Information Management, Peking University**, under the supervision of [**Professor Shijuan Li (李世娟)**](http://www.im.pku.edu.cn/szll/tsgxjys/zrlsj/index.htm). I obtained my **Master’s degree** from the **Department of Information Management, Beijing Jiaotong University**, advised by [**Professor Runtong Zhang (张润彤)**](http://sem.bjtu.edu.cn/show-594-47.html). Prior to that, I completed my **Bachelor’s degree** through a joint program between **Rochester Institute of Technology** and **Beijing Jiaotong University**.

My research interest includes **medical informatics**, **collaborator recommendation**, and **cross-cultural digital narratives**. So far, I have published 3 research papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wtcf_r4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Scholar-7%20citations-9cf?logo=Google%20Scholar"></a> in top journals including **Decision Support Systems**, **Artificial Intelligence in Medicine**, and **Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services**. I also served as a peer reviewer for journals like **Expert Systems with Applications** and **The Journal of Supercomputing**.
