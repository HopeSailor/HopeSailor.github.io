<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a **Ph.D. student** in the **Department of Information Management, Peking University**, under the supervision of [**Professor Shijuan Li (Êùé‰∏ñÂ®ü)**](http://www.im.pku.edu.cn/szll/tsgxjys/zrlsj/index.htm). I obtained my **Master‚Äôs degree** from the **Department of Information Management, Beijing Jiaotong University**, advised by [**Professor Runtong Zhang (Âº†Ê∂¶ÂΩ§)**](http://sem.bjtu.edu.cn/show-594-47.html). Prior to that, I completed my **Bachelor‚Äôs degree** through a joint program between **Rochester Institute of Technology** and **Beijing Jiaotong University**.

My research interest includes **information science**, **medical informatics**, **human-centered recommendation**, and **digital media**. My work has been published <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wtcf_r4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Scholar-33%20citations-9cf?logo=Google%20Scholar"></a> in top journals such as *Decision Support Systems*, *Information Processing & Management*, and *Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*. I also served as a peer reviewer for journals like *Expert Systems with Applications* and *The Journal of Supercomputing*.
