I am currently a **Ph.D. student** in the **Department of Information Management, Peking University**, under the supervision of [**Professor Shijuan Li (李世娟)**](http://www.im.pku.edu.cn/szll/tsgxjys/zrlsj/index.htm). I obtained my **Master’s degree** from the **Department of Information Management, Beijing Jiaotong University**, advised by [**Professor Runtong Zhang (张润彤)**](http://sem.bjtu.edu.cn/show-594-47.html). Prior to that, I completed my **Bachelor’s degree** through a joint program between **Rochester Institute of Technology** and **Beijing Jiaotong University**.

My research interests include **information science**, **medical informatics**, **human-centered recommendation**, and **digital narratives**. My work has been published <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wtcf_r4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Scholar-40%20citations-9cf?logo=Google%20Scholar"></a> in top journals such as *Decision Support Systems*, *Information Processing & Management*, and *Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*. I also served as a peer reviewer for journals like *Artificial Intelligence Review*, *Expert Systems with Applications* , and *Journal of Big Data*.
