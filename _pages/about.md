<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a **Ph.D. student** in the Department of Information Management at **Department of Information Management, Peking University (北京大学信息管理系)**. Previously, I obtained my **Master's degree** from **Department of Information Management, Beijing Jiaotong University (北京交通大学信息管理系)**, advised by Professor [**Runtong Zhang (张润彤)**](http://sem.bjtu.edu.cn/show-594-47.html). During my master's studies, I participated in several research projects, including those funded by the **National Natural Science Foundation of China and National Social Science Foundation of China**.

My research interest includes **medical informatics**, **collaborator recommendation**, and **cross-cultural digital narratives**. I have published several papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wtcf_r4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Scholar-6%20citations-9cf?logo=Google%20Scholar"></a> in high-impact journals such as **Decision Support Systems**, **Artificial Intelligence in Medicine**, and **Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services**. I also served as a peer reviewer for journals like **Expert Systems with Applications** and **The Journal of Supercomputing**.
